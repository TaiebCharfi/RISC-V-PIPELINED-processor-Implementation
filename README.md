# RISC-V-PIPELINED-processor-Implementation
This project focuses on the implementation of a pipelined processor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) using Quartus and Verilog. The RISC-V ISA is a free and open standard ISA designed for various computing devices.

In this project, we are implementing a pipelined 32-bit RISC-V ISA-based processor in Verilog
The pipelined processor is a fundamental component of modern CPUs, enhancing performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. This project implements a basic 5-stage pipelined processor for the RISC-V ISA, including stages such as Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
The circuit below illustrates the sub-modules used and their interactions:
